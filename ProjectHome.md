snort2scapy parses [Snort](http://www.snort.org/) rules and generates [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) executable code for testing of [Snort](http://www.snort.org/) IDS/IPS systems and installations. The output of snort2scapy can be executed out-of-the-box by [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) and can be used to  establish TCP connections to servers, as required.
